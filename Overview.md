Analysis using Excel

Performed analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more
riders. Data analysis Phases: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, & Act

ABOUT THE COMPANY

Cyclist is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

SCENARIO

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. We must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations so that Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations and act upon them.
